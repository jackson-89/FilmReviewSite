The app I am planning to design is a Film/TV/Game review app that allows users to login and create reviews on any Film/TV/Games they wish to rate. The app will allow users to view other users reviews and view a list of all the reviews made on the different forms of entertainment. The purpose of it is to give casual film/game enjoyers a platform that shows other people's opinions on things instead of the usual major corporations that tend to give politically/biased based reviews on films etc. It is designed to be a platform that allows for casual discussion on topics that people find interesting.
